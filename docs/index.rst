Welcome to the ARISE Framework documentation!
=============================================

**Lumache** (/lu'make/) is a Python library for cooks and food lovers
that creates recipes mixing random ingredients.
It pulls data from the `Open Food Facts database <https://world.openfoodfacts.org/>`_
and offers a *simple* and *intuitive* API.

Check out the :ref:`getting_started` section for further information on how to install and use the ARISE Framework, or dive into the :ref:`project` section to learn more about the project itself.
