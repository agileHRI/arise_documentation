Overall Introduction to the ARISE Framework
-------------------------------------------
The ARISE framework is an open-source software stack which targets the intersection between intelligent robotics, 
middleware technologies, and IIoT applications. It is specially designed to accelerate the agile and cost-effective
development of collaborative robotics applications. 

ARISE combines three core technologies (Vulcanexus, FIWARE, and ROS4HRI) in an all-in-one middleware solution along with  
collection of reusable robot skills and IIoT features which are specifically tailored to support human-robot collaboration 
in industrial tasks.
