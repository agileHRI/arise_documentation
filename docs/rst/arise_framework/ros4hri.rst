ROS4HRI is a comprehensive framework designed to facilitate human-robot
interaction (HRI) using the Robot Operating System (ROS). It provides a suite
of tools and libraries that enable developers to create intuitive and effective
HRI applications.

It includes:

#. a **core standard** (REP-155) defining conventions and topics for HRI,
#. **message definitions** to represent humans and HRI-related data,
#. **libraries** to facilitate the use of these messages in C++ and Python,
#. a set of **skills and actions definitions** for common HRI functionalities,
#. a set of **ROS packages** implementing perceptions and actions for HRI,
#. **tools** to generate ROS4HRI-compliant packages, simulate HRI scenarios,
   and visualize HRI data.

In the context of the ARISE project, ROS4HRI provides:

- a standard way to **represent humans and interactions with humans**,
- a **standard architecture to implement interactive, human-aware robot applications**,
- a library of standard **skills definitions** to implement capabilities on
  your robots that are compatible with ARISE and the broader ROS4HRI ecosystem.
